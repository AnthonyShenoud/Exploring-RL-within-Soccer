#Exploring Reinforcement Learning within Soccer

Abstract- The realm of soccer is heavily invested in player research, development, scouting, and various other facets, contributing billions annually. With technological advancements, teams increasingly turn to dynamic programming techniques to model gameplay, strategies, and tactics. This study shares a pipeline for simulating soccer matches, offering outcomes and insights into individual player contributions. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, the investigation aims to discern the attributes pivotal in enhancing overall team performance. Although in its beginning stages, this pipeline establishes a groundwork for more intricate techniques and methodologies.
